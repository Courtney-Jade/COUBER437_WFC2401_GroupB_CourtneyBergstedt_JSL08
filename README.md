# JSL08 Project Overview 
 This project demonstrates the implementation of the Singleton pattern for managing a single instance of a BankBranch class throughout an application. The Singleton pattern ensures that multiple instances of the BankBranch class refer to the same object, maintaining consistency in branch information.
